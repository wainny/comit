I hope you have learned a lot in this course. I am very proud of you to have come this far and you should be too! 

If there is a will, there will be always a way. Walk the path you have chosen courageously, and you efforts will be rewarded! 

I hope you would get the job of your dream very soon, I would be extremely happy for you! 

Best of luck on your new endeavours, cross-refenrece the materials here whenever you'd need to. And don't be afraid to reach out to me in times of needs!
